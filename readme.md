# Installation
In bash run

```
cd ~/Library
git clone https://github.com/b-hayes/KeyBindings
```
And then restart any applicaiton you want to try the new bindings with.
Or restart MacOs entirely.
(some applicaiton will ignore defaults and us their own configs anyaway)

### Default State
Currently only the Home and End keys will be remapped thats what I found most annoying about MacOs so thats all I am using at the moment.

### trusktrWindowsStyleMappings
I have inlcuded someone elses keymappings I found on git hub as a sub repo that do look good but are not quite what I want but a good reference. (altho the url he uses as a reference in his comments no longer exists)


## Intentions
The plan is to modify trusktr mappings and progress to the ultimate key mapping for a windows 10 user.

Hoever there are some things as far as I can see that can not be remapped without 3rd party software and a bunch of other issues.
- Alt+Tab
- Window Snapping is not a feature of macos and as far as I can see there no way to add keyboard shortcuts for it.
- Remapping fucntion keys for thos thos super annoying macbook keyboards with FN on the very bottomn left.
